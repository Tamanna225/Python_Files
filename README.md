# Python_Files
This repository contains various python files related to recursion, sorting and file handeling.


1.Calculator using if-else:- This program uses if else to do simple calculations in python

2.Student information using admission number:- This programs is used to find the details of a particular student using their admisssion number here we are just basically using dictionaries here.

3.Bubble sort:- as the name suggests we are just doing bubble sort but with the help of recursion

4.Insertion sort:- In this program we are doing insertion sort with the help of recursion.

5.Binary Search

6.Basic Calculator using function:- Again this is just a calculator but this has been made using functions.

7.Factorial by recursion:- In this program we are basically finding factoriasl of a number using recursion.

8.Sum of n natural numbers using recursion:- Here in this program we are finding sum of n natural numbers using recursion.

9.Fibonacci series using recursion:- In this program we are finding a fibonacci series using recursion.

10.To copy content of one file to another

11.to store and display multiple integers

12.To insert a record in student file


10,11,12 are programs related to file handeling.
